Once your allotted time for the day has been used up, the sites you have blocked will be inaccessible until the next day. </p><hr><h3>Why do I need StayFocusd?</h3><p>Because you&#39;re human.</p><p> You sit down at the computer, and you swear you&#39;ll be productive. Next thing you know, it&#39;s twelve hours later. You&#39;ve checked your email, updated your Facebook status, browsed the trending topics on Twitter, read your RSS feeds, looked up your favorite band on Wikipedia, vanity googled yourself, cyber-stalked your ex, your ex&#39;s lover, and several high-school crushes, and lost a week&#39;s pay playing online poker. </p><p>What you haven&#39;t done is <i>WORK.</i></p><p> The fact is, it&#39;s very hard to stay focused on work or school when you have all the world&#39;s information, news, music, and *cough*porn*cough* at your fingertips. Sometimes self-control is in short supply, and you need a little help keeping on track. </p><hr><h3>How do I use it?</h3><p> StayFocusd adds an icon to your browser, to the right of the address bar. Clicking it will display a popup window with one primary option: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Block this entire site:</strong> This will block you from browsing <i>any page</i> on the current site once time runs out. For example, if you block cnn.com, it will block all pages on cnn.com, www.cnn.com, politics.cnn.com, www.cnn.com/some-article-title, etc. </p></li></ul><p> You can also click Advanced Options to expose more specific options for blocking and allowing the domain. Let&#39;s use politics.cnn.com as an example: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Allow this entire site:</strong> This will allow you to browse every page on the current site, even after time runs out. </p></li><li><p><strong>Only block pages on politics.cnn.com:</strong> This will prevent you from browsing <i>only</i> pages on the current subdomain. If you block politics.cnn.com, you will still be allowed to browse sportsillustrated.cnn.com, as well as www.cnn.com and cnn.com. </p><p><i>NOTE: </i> If you only block www.cnn.com, you will still be able to access cnn.com ... which kind of defeats the purpose of blocking the site. This option should only be used to block subdomains other than www. </p></li><li><p><strong>Only allow pages on politics.cnn.com:</strong> This will allow you to browse pages on the current subdomain, even if the rest of the domain is blocked. For example, you may want to block yourself from the entire cnn.com website <i>except</i> politics.cnn.com. </p></li><li><p><strong>Enter a custom url:</strong> This will allow you to block or allow any specific page, path, or query. For example, you may want to block yourself from Google Reader, at google.com/reader. Entering this custom url and clicking &quot;Block custom url&quot; will block your access to google.com/reader without preventing you from accessing any other Google url for search, email, docs, etc. </p><p> Likewise, you can use the custom url to allow only a specific path while preventing access to the rest of a domain. For example, you may choose to block the entire Delicious site at delicious.com. However, if you want to use Delicious to bookmark a site, you&#39;ll need to allow access to delicious.com/save. Entering delicious.com/save into the custom url field and clicking &quot;Allow custom url&quot; will let you use Delicious for bookmarking while still blocking other delicious.com pages. </p></li></ul><hr><h3>How do I enable StayFocusd in Incognito mode?</h3><p> Click Chrome&#39;s Wrench icon (top right, below close button), then Tools &gt; Extensions. Look for the StayFocusd extension, and check the &quot;Allow in incognito&quot; checkbox. </p><hr><h3> Is there any way to remove the ability to disable/uninstall the extension? </h3><p> Unfortunately, no. Chrome extensions can not remove the disable or uninstall options. I do have a request in to the Chrome developers to add this ability, but I don&#39;t expect them to implement my request (ever). </p><p> However, you CAN prevent yourself from accessing the extensions settings page by adding chrome://extensions to your Blocked Sites list. Once your time is up, you won&#39;t be able to access the settings to disable StayFocusd. </p><hr><h3> Can you make this extension work for other browsers? Is there a version for my phone? Can it block desktop software or other Chrome apps? </h3><p> I wish. Extensions only work in Chrome or Edge -- they can&#39;t affect any other software, browsers, devices, or Chrome apps/extensions. If you find yourself using other browsers to cheat, your best bet is to uninstall them. Or you can delete the shortcuts from your desktop, quick start, start menu, etc. Making it more inconvenient to boot up another browser may help curtail the urge to cheat. </p><p> You can download the Microsoft Edge version of StayFocusd <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/stayfocusd/mnmbgeanfddcfbcifopgggikdpnimebe" target="_blank">here</a>. </p><p> Another alternative is to use another app like <a class="link link-secondary link-hover not-prose" href="https://freedom.sjv.io/stayfocusd30" target="_blank">Freedom</a> to block other browsers, apps, and mobile devices. </p><hr><h3> How do I stop the update notice (NEW badge on StayFocusd icon) from being displayed every time StayFocusd updates? </h3>',28)),o("p",null,[e[12]||(e[12]=t(" You can disable the update notice in the Customize section of the ")),o("a",{class:"link link-secondary link-hover not-prose",href:("getOptionsPage"in n?n.getOptionsPage:i(s))("settings")},"Options",8,A),e[13]||(e[13]=t(" page.
